# Phase 6: Complex Smart Contract Flow Simulation

## Objective
Create a comprehensive system for simulating complex smart contract interactions involving multiple contract types, atomic swaps, permission management, and flow visualization.

## Overview
This phase introduces advanced contract flow simulation capabilities that allow users to:
- Deploy and manage multiple interconnected contracts
- Execute atomic swaps between different token standards
- Manage complex permission systems (allowlists, roles, allowances)
- Visualize contract interaction flows
- Version and template complex multi-step operations

## Key Features

### Multi-Contract Ecosystems
- Deploy multiple contract types in coordinated workflows
- Support ERC20, ERC1155, and custom settlement contracts
- Manage contract dependencies and deployment ordering
- Track contract relationships and interactions

### Atomic Operations
- Execute multi-step transactions that succeed or fail together
- Implement atomic swaps between ERC20 and ERC1155 tokens
- Handle complex approval and transfer sequences
- Provide rollback mechanisms for failed operations

### Permission Management
- Configure allowlists for restricted contract access
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Manage token allowances across multiple contracts
- Validate permissions before execution

### Flow Visualization
- Visual representation of contract interaction flows
- Real-time execution tracking with step-by-step progress
- Graphical display of token transfers and state changes
- Interactive flow diagrams with clickable components

### Advanced Features
- Flow versioning and comparison
- Template library for common interaction patterns
- Simulation mode for testing without gas costs
- Export/import of complex flow configurations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can deploy multiple interdependent contracts in sequence
- [ ] Atomic swap operations execute successfully or fail gracefully
- [ ] Permission systems prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Visual flow representation updates in real-time
- [ ] Flow templates can be saved, loaded, and shared
- [ ] Versioning system tracks flow evolution over time
