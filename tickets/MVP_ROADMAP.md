# MVP Development Roadmap

## Project: Smart Contract Stress Testing Web Application

### Overview
A Next.js application for stress-testing Ethereum smart contracts (ERC-20 focus) with performance analytics and visualization.

### MVP Definition
The MVP includes core functionality to:
1. Deploy ERC-20 contracts on local/testnet
2. Execute stress tests with configurable parameters
3. Monitor performance in real-time
4. Visualize results with basic analytics

### Phase Timeline

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Basic infrastructure and connectivity  
**Tickets**: TICKET-001 to TICKET-005  
**Deliverables**:
- Working Next.js app with Tailwind
- Blockchain connectivity (Anvil + Sepolia)
- Wallet integration
- Basic UI components

#### Phase 2: Contract Deployment (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Deploy and manage smart contracts  
**Tickets**: TICKET-006 to TICKET-010  
**Deliverables**:
- Contract deployment UI
- Deployment tracking
- Gas estimation
- Contract interaction hooks

#### Phase 3: Stress Testing (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Core testing functionality  
**Tickets**: TICKET-011 to TICKET-016  
**Deliverables**:
- Test configuration interface
- Test execution engine
- Multi-account support
- Real-time monitoring

#### Phase 4: Analytics (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Performance metrics and visualization  
**Tickets**: TICKET-017 to TICKET-021  
**Deliverables**:
- Metrics collection
- Performance dashboard
- Data visualization
- Report generation

#### Phase 5: Explorer & Polish (Week 4+)
**Goal**: Advanced features and refinement  
**Tickets**: TICKET-022 to TICKET-026  
**Deliverables**:
- Block explorer view
- Advanced test features
- UI/UX improvements
- Documentation

### MVP Priorities

#### Must Have (MVP)
- Local Anvil connection
- ERC-20 deployment
- Basic stress test (100 sequential transfers)
- Transaction monitoring
- Gas usage metrics
- Simple results display

#### Should Have (Post-MVP)
- Sepolia testnet support
- Concurrent testing
- Performance charts
- Block explorer
- Test history

#### Nice to Have (Future)
- Custom contract support
- Advanced scenarios
- API access
- Test automation
- Multi-chain support

### Technical Decisions

1. **State Management**: React Query for server state, Context for app state
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
3. **Testing**: Foundry for contracts, Vitest for frontend
4. **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend, local Foundry for contracts
5. **Data Storage**: LocalStorage for MVP, consider IndexedDB later

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance**: Start with small test batches, optimize later
2. **Complexity**: Focus on ERC-20 first, expand contract types later
3. **UX**: Keep UI minimal, prioritize functionality
4. **Testing**: Manual testing for MVP, automated tests post-MVP

### Success Metrics

- [ ] Can deploy an ERC-20 token in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Can run 100 transaction test successfully
- [ ] Performance metrics are accurate (Â±5%)
- [ ] UI updates in real-time during tests
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in core flow

### Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 tickets
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Create initial UI mockups
4. Document API design
5. Plan user testing sessions
