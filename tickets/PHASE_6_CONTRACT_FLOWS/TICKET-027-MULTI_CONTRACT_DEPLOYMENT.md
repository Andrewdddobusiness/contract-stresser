# TICKET-027: Multi-Contract Deployment System

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated**: 4 hours  
**Phase**: 6 - Complex Smart Contract Flow Simulation

## Description
Create a system for deploying and managing multiple interconnected smart contracts in a coordinated workflow. This system should handle deployment ordering, dependency management, and configuration of contract relationships.

## Requirements

### Contract Types Support
- **ERC20 Tokens**: Standard fungible tokens with configurable parameters
- **ERC1155 Multi-Tokens**: Multi-standard tokens supporting both fungible and non-fungible assets
- **Settlement Contracts**: Custom contracts for handling atomic swaps and escrow
- **Access Control Contracts**: RBAC and permission management contracts
- **Registry Contracts**: Contract discovery and relationship mapping

### Deployment Orchestration
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic ordering based on contract dependencies
- **Parameter Injection**: Pass deployment addresses to dependent contracts
- **Rollback Capability**: Undo partial deployments on failure
- **Parallel Deployment**: Deploy independent contracts simultaneously
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time deployment progress and status

### Configuration Management
- **Deployment Plans**: Define multi-contract deployment workflows
- **Environment Profiles**: Different configurations for local/testnet/mainnet
- **Parameter Templates**: Reusable configuration sets
- **Validation Rules**: Pre-deployment checks and validations

## Technical Implementation

### Core Services
```typescript
// services/contracts/multiDeployment.ts
interface DeploymentPlan {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  contracts: ContractConfig[]
  dependencies: DependencyMap
  parameters: DeploymentParameters
}

interface ContractConfig {
  id: string
  type: 'ERC20' | 'ERC1155' | 'Settlement' | 'AccessControl' | 'Registry'
  name: string
  constructorArgs: any[]
  dependencies: string[]
  postDeployActions: PostDeployAction[]
}

class MultiContractDeploymentService {
  async createDeploymentPlan(config: DeploymentPlanConfig): Promise<DeploymentPlan>
  async executeDeploymentPlan(planId: string): Promise<DeploymentResult>
  async validateDeploymentPlan(plan: DeploymentPlan): Promise<ValidationResult>
  async rollbackDeployment(deploymentId: string): Promise<void>
}
```

### UI Components
- **Deployment Planner**: Visual interface for creating deployment workflows
- **Contract Builder**: Form-based contract configuration
- **Dependency Graph**: Visual representation of contract relationships
- **Deployment Monitor**: Real-time progress tracking
- **Status Dashboard**: Overview of all deployed contract ecosystems

### Contract Templates
```solidity
// contracts/templates/SettlementContract.sol
contract AtomicSwapSettlement {
    mapping(bytes32 => SwapOrder) public swapOrders;
    
    struct SwapOrder {
        address tokenA;
        address tokenB;
        uint256 amountA;
        uint256 amountB;
        address participant1;
        address participant2;
        uint256 deadline;
        SwapStatus status;
    }
    
    function createSwapOrder(...) external;
    function executeSwap(bytes32 orderId) external;
    function cancelSwap(bytes32 orderId) external;
}
```

## Tasks

### Backend Services
- [ ] Create `services/contracts/multiDeployment.ts` with orchestration logic
- [ ] Implement dependency resolution algorithm
- [ ] Build contract template system
- [ ] Add deployment rollback mechanism
- [ ] Create parameter injection system

### Contract Templates
- [ ] Design Settlement contract for atomic swaps
- [ ] Create configurable ERC20 template with advanced features
- [ ] Build ERC1155 template with batch operations
- [ ] Implement AccessControl contract with role management
- [ ] Design Registry contract for contract discovery

### Database Schema
- [ ] Design deployment plan storage structure
- [ ] Create deployment history tracking
- [ ] Implement contract relationship mapping
- [ ] Add deployment status persistence

### UI Components
- [ ] Build deployment plan creation interface
- [ ] Create contract configuration forms
- [ ] Implement dependency visualization
- [ ] Design deployment progress tracker
- [ ] Add ecosystem overview dashboard

### Integration
- [ ] Integrate with existing contract deployment system
- [ ] Connect to wallet and transaction management
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Implement deployment persistence and recovery

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can create deployment plans with multiple contracts
- [ ] Dependency resolution works correctly
- [ ] Deployment executes in proper order
- [ ] Failed deployments can be rolled back
- [ ] Real-time status updates during deployment
- [ ] Contract relationships are properly configured
- [ ] Templates can be customized and reused

## Dependencies
- Existing contract deployment infrastructure
- Wallet connection and transaction signing
- Database for deployment plan storage

## Notes
- Consider gas optimization for batch deployments
- Implement proper error handling for partial failures
- Support for different deployment strategies (sequential vs parallel)
- Future extensibility for custom contract types
